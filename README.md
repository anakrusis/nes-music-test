This is a very small (NROM 128 = 24KiB total) Famicom/NES demo (not quite a game yet) featuring two feuding farmers and their frequent fights! They pit all the farm animals against each other in feud after feud. Whose side are you on?

May morph into some sort of lighthearted turn-based strategy game. "Turn-based" already complete, "game" part not so much. :) The idea was to make something which is netplayable over an emulator that supports multiplayer like [Mesen](https://www.mesen.ca/) or [Nestopia](http://nestopia.sourceforge.net/). The turn-based nature lets it be fully playable with lag or ping disparities.

Uses the [Famitone 4.1 audio library](https://github.com/nesdoug/famitone4.1) by shiru and nesdoug. Inspiration and code ideas from the [nesdev wiki!](http://wiki.nesdev.com/w/index.php/Nesdev_Wiki)
